Etcsvn
========

Etcsvn is a command line program for managing system configurations in 
subversion. Etcsvn doesn't make a working copy out of your /etc, but uses 
a temporary workspace. Etcsvn will preserve ownership/permissions of the 
files being tracked.

--------------------------


The Problem
--------------------

Suppose you want to keep track of important config files on a system in a
subversion repository.  There are a few problems with using svn directly.
One problem is that you need to keep track of ownership and permission
modes of files and directories that you are tracking.  It is somewhat difficult 
to manage the repository without access to a working copy, but a working
copy is twice as big as what it works on.  Also there is the possibility that 
you want to track some files in /var or somewhere else.

-------------------------

What to do about it
---------------------------

Etcsvn tries to provide a simple command line interface to manage files
on you system.  What it does is make a temporary working copy on the
system.  Etcsvn must be run as root, and it sets a umask of 077 before
creating any file or directory.  This makes the working copy as secure as
possible.  This is also true when restoring files, as the ownership and 
permissions are set after the file is created.

I am trying to make etcsvn a bridge between your system and the working
copy.  The goal is to provide only what is necessary to aid a system admin
in being able to edit system configuration files in a convenient manner with
tools that may not be available on the system your configuring.


-------------------

Limitations
-------------------

I am currently working on getting etcsvn to handle symbolic links.  I am also
adding an option to track directories recursively.


There is no revision support yet.

There is should be a little work done on the repository layout.  It should be
possible to place many systems in one repository, or have separate 
repositories for clients, networks, etc.

Etcsvn makes no attempt to authenticate to your repository.  This will probably
not change anytime soon, because I feel that it should be the job of the script or
administrator to handle this.

Currently there needs to be a ini style config file in the root of your repository
named "etcsvn.conf".  There is only one section used in this file currently, and it
is called "main".  In the "main" section there is only one option supported, and it is
called "files".  The "files" option is a list of absolute path files separated with
newlines.

---------------------

Dependencies
---------------------

python_ -- A good scripting language

pysvn_ -- I like this extension better than the official one.

subversion_ --  If not a dependency, then highly recommended

Etcsvn should work as is on any Unix/posix type system.

-----------------------------

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

This program is intended for system administrators who intend to
use this either interactively or in shell scripts.

Documentation
---------------------

This program is designed to have an interface similar to svn.  Just typing
"etcsvn" will give you a usage synopsis.

Usage: etcsvn <cmd>
With these subcommands:

- checkup

  This command will check all of the files listed in the
  repository configuration, and update changed files.  Doesn't check
  for ownership/permission changes.

- restore	

  This command will export files tracked in your repository
  configuration to the system.  This command will overwrite any files
  already there.

- create	

  This command will create a local repository on your system,
  using the url option in the config.

- listfiles

  This command will list the files being tracked in the
  repository.

- update

  This command will update your working copy.

- status		

  This command will report the status of your workspace.

- export

  This command takes a filename argument. This command will
  export a file from your working copy to the system.

- clean

  This command will remove your workspace, modified or not.

- commit

  This command will commit the workspace to the repository.

- import

  This command takes a filename argument.  If the filename
  doesn't start with '/' then it will be referenced from your $PWD.  Only
  files are supported, etcsvn is unable to handle symbolic links, or 
  directory arguments.  It will handle parent directories to the file
  correctly though.
  Example:  etcsvn import /etc/fstab

- backup

  This command will update your working copy with all the files
  being tracked in the repository configuration.  This command will track
  ownership/permission changes.

- setup

  This command will checkout a working copy from the repository
  to your workspace.




---------------------------

TODO
----------------------

This program is in it's alpha stage.  I would like to get some input on
what people find useful/wrong with this program.  I would like to get
both the command line interface and the python interface to be clear
and understandable.  The command line interface should remain
simple, with reasonable defaults, and not stray too far from similarity
with svn.


- Symbolic links need to be handled.

  + preliminary work has started on this

- Handle propset, propget, etc...

  + This seems to be working ok.

  + Handling mtime with props

- Implement diff subcommand

- Handle directories recursively

- Add repository url as command line option

- Use a different directory for /


--------------------

Using a remote repository
-------------------------------------

Here is an example of using a remote repository accessed by svn+ssh, to
remotely administer a server, using ssh-agent.  It is assumed that you
are familiar with handling ssh keys.

Suppose your repository is located on server "goldie" in /repos, and you need to be
able to access it from server "webfoot".  You need ssh access to both goldie, and
webfoot.  Make sure that the ssh-agent is aware of the appropriate key(s), then from 
your workstation, ssh -A webfoot.  On webfoot, in /etc/etcsvn.conf, make sure that the 
url is "svn+ssh://username@goldie/repos/hosts/webfoot" or something that reflects your
repository.
